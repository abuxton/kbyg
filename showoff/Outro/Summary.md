In summary, We actually managed 3 workshops in one. 

* How to test Puppets supported modules.

* Run  some tests [https://forge.puppetlabs.com/modules?endorsements=supported](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/modules?endorsements=supported) to forge supported list.
* Run this at home and try extend it into your working day.
