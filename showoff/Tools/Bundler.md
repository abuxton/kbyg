# Bundler #
## Managing Ruby application dependancys ##

Things you want to do;

 * Test the thing.
 * Repeat the test.
 * Save your self reinstalling every time and documenting all the things!

Bundler is one part of how we do the above, `Bundler provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact gems and versions that are needed.`
The Gemspec becomes part of your module files and all you need to do is document installing Bundler, or maybe you just do that with Puppet too!
