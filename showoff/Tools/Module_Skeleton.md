# Puppet Module Skeletons #
## So how do we share all this love and reusability? ##

Well lets take a little from here, and a little from there and add a little extra.

`As a feature, puppet module tool will use ~/.puppet/var/puppet-module/skeleton as template for its generate command. The files provided here are meant to be better templates for use with the puppet module tool`.
<br />
So lets take a few things and add them to our module skeleton then!, but what?

* Gemfile
* Rakefile

Well this gives us a base functionality tested and working we can build on. but what else?
