# Command Line Interface #
## Some times you just want to run the test! ##

I don't believe any thing ever turned up polished?

Beaker is no exception and so you can choose to run your tests individually and increment them with out the overheads of all the set up.

So the command line client is always available https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/wiki/The-Command-Line.
