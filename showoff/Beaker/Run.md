# Running the tests #
## Pressing Go before you know! ##

So how do we run the tests? let us start with the following; 
#
    @@@ Shell
      # beaker --help 
#
or preferably
#
    @@@ Shell
      # bundle exec rspec spec/<testfolder>
#
The latter line is the current preferable usage, and what we invoked in the demo.
