## What another language to learn? ##

OK, so not every one love to learn a new language, and if your new to testing were actually getting you to learn 2 languages, 3 if this is your first mis adventure in Puppet, and possibly 4 if you've never learned ruby and want to go that far.

## Don't be scared, there are good reasons, honestly..

* Portability.
* Extending the functionality in a like for like manner.
* Actually breaking down the barriers between languages.
