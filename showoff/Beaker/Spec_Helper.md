# Spec Helpers #
## Extract the repeatable bits! ##

`Update spec_helper_acceptance.rb to reflect the module under test. You will need to set the correct module name and add any module dependencies. Place the file in the /spec directory.` [spec helper](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/wiki/How-to-Write-a-Beaker-Test-for-a-Module#create-the-spec_helper_acceptancerb)

We use the spec helper for any set up tasks that we want to repeat that are not directly part of the SUT, sometimes this gets a little confused. But what ever works for you.
